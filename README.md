This project is an analysis of a dataset provided by Yelp. The analysis is performed entirely in SQL. 
There are two parts to this project. In the first part, the dataset is simply profiled in order to obtain a better understanding of the provided data. The second part consists of three separate analyses. 
The first analysis examines restaurants in Toronto and divides them into two distinct groups - a '2-3 star rated' group as well as a '4-5 star rated' group. The two groups are then analyzed for potential differences.
The second analysis looks for differences between businesses on Yelp that are still open and businesses on the site that have closed.
The third analysis performed on the dataset looked to determine whether a restaurant offering the options of delivery and accepting credit cards had any effect on the businesses overall star rating and the number of reviews they received.
